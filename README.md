This is a create-react-native-app test application.

App.js is the main editable file.

To test the app, I'm using expo.

'exp start' lauches the app on LAN or WAN.

A QR code is shown and it allows expo app on a mobile phone to load the app and test it.

'exp build:android' is the command to create the APK file on android.
